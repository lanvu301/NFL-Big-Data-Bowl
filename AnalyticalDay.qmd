Step 0:

plays <- read.csv("plays.csv")
players <- read.csv("nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/players.csv")
```

Step 1: Clean data
```{r}
colSums(is.na(plays))
```


```{r}
handle_missing_values <- function(df, threshold = 0.7) {
  # Step 1: Calculate percentage of missing values per column
  missing_percentage <- colMeans(is.na(df))
  
  # Step 2: Drop columns exceeding threshold

  # Step 3: Separate numeric and categorical columns
  numeric_cols <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
  categorical_cols <- !numeric_cols
  
  # Step 4: Impute missing values

STEP 2: Relationship BETWEEN OFFENSE FORMATION AND YARDGAINED
A: Basic distribtuion of YardGained
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(clean_plays, aes(x = yardsGained)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Yards Gained",
       x = "Yards Gained",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```
Barplot of OffenseFormation
```{r}
ggplot(clean_plays, aes(x = offenseFormation)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorange", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Offensive Formations",
       x = "Offensive Formation",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
Bar plot of distribution of passCoverage
```{r}
ggplot(clean_plays, aes(x = pff_passCoverage)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "seagreen3", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Pass Coverage Types",
       x = "PFF Pass Coverage",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

formation_success <- clean_plays %>%
  group_by(offenseFormation) %>%
  summarise(Average_Yards_Gained = mean(yardsGained, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Average_Yards_Gained))

# Step 2: Print results in styled console output
cat("\nAverage Yards Gained by Formation:\n")
cat(strrep("=", 50), "\n")
cat(sprintf("%-25s %-25s\n", "Formation", "Average Yards Gained"))
cat(strrep("-", 50), "\n")

for (i in seq_len(nrow(formation_success))) {
  formation <- formation_success$offenseFormation[i]
  yards <- formation_success$Average_Yards_Gained[i]
  
  
  cat(sprintf("%-25s %-25.2f\n", formation, yards))
}

# Step 3: Visualization (bar chart)
ggplot(formation_success, aes(x = reorder(offenseFormation, Average_Yards_Gained),
                              y = Average_Yards_Gained,
                              fill = Average_Yards_Gained>0))+

    x = "Offensive Formation",
    y = "Average Yards Gained"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")



```
Ok trying new plot with freq added to the graph
```{r}
formation_summary <- clean_plays %>%
  group_by(offenseFormation) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_yards = mean(yardsGained, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  )

ggplot(formation_summary, aes(x = reorder(offenseFormation, avg_yards))) +
  geom_col(aes(y = count / max(count) * max(avg_yards)), 
           fill = "gray80", width = 0.6) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_yards, group = 1, color = "Average Yards"), linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_yards, color = "Average Yards"), size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Average Yards" = "darkgreen")) +
  labs(
    title = "Formation Effectiveness (Frequency vs Average Yards)",
    x = "Offensive Formation",
    y = "Scaled Count / Average Yards"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```

Ok next is OffenseFormation by PassCoverage


Let's group the pass_coverage to smaller group

```{r}
clean_plays$coverage_group <- clean_plays$pff_passCoverage

clean_plays$coverage_group <- forcats::fct_collapse(
  clean_plays$coverage_group,
  Cover_3 = c("Cover-3", "Cover-3 Cloud Left", "Cover-3 Cloud Right",
              "Cover-3 Seam", "Cover-3 Double Cloud"),
  Cover_6 = c("Cover 6-Left", "Cover-6 Right"),
  Cover_1 = c("Cover-1", "Cover-1 Double"),
  Other_Rare = c("Bracket", "Miscellaneous", "Prevent", "2-Man", "Goal Line")
)
```
See the distribution after grouping

```{r}
ggplot(clean_plays, aes(x = coverage_group)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "seagreen3", color = "black") +
  geom_text(
    stat = "count",
    aes(label = paste0(round((..count..) / sum(..count..) * 100, 1), "%")),
    vjust = -0.1,
size = 4
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Pass Coverage Types",
    x = "PFF Pass Coverage",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


ggplot(clean_plays, aes(x = offenseFormation)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "seagreen3", color = "black") +
  geom_text(
    stat = "count",
    aes(label = paste0(round((..count..) / sum(..count..) * 100, 1), "%")),
    vjust = -0.1,
    size = 4
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Offense Formation",
    x = "Offense Formation",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Now run the plot
```{r}
library(dplyr)
